For question: Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in? and/or Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?

SELECT E.country, COUNT (DISTINCT(B.customer_id)) AS number_of_customers
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
WHERE active = 1
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY number_of_customers DESC
