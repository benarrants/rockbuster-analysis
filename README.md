## Objective
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

The task is to load all of Rockbuster’s data into a relational database management system (RDBMS). Then, use SQL to analyze the data to answer any ad-hoc business questions and help with the launch strategy for the new online video service.
